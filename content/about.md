description: "Cloud consultant, DevOps engineer, and builder of things"
---

I'm a cloud consultant with nearly 20 years of experience in cloud computing, DevOps, Infrastructure as Code, networking, and Python development.

I write about the intersection of technology and business - the practical realities of building systems that actually work, and the lessons learned from doing it wrong first.

## What I do

By day, I help organisations navigate the complexities of cloud architecture, automation, and modern infrastructure. I've worked across AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, and just about every flavour of infrastructure tooling that's existed over the past two decades.

## Why I write

Most technical content online falls into two camps: either too surface-level to be useful, or so deep in the weeds it loses sight of why any of it matters. I'm trying to bridge that gap - writing for people who need to actually build and ship things, not just pass certification exams.
