After nearly 20 years in cloud and DevOps, I'm finally putting words on the internet. Here's why.

## The case for writing

I've spent most of my career solving problems, building systems, and explaining technical concepts to people who needed to make decisions about them. What I haven't done is write publicly.

That changes now.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about:

- **Cloud architecture and DevOps** — the practical stuff, not the vendor marketing
- **Building things** — lessons from consulting, side projects, and everything in between  
- **The business of technology** — because technical excellence that doesn't ship is just expensive procrastination

## The format

Longer posts will live here. Shorter thoughts go on X and LinkedIn. The goal is to think out loud, share what I've learned, and maybe help someone avoid the mistakes I've already made.

Let's see where this goes.
